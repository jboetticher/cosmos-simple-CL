## Solidity Code
To make your own instance on the mainnet you will have to:  
1. Compile this code to a network (please test on a public testnet first)
2. Compile to an abi go file with solc via this [guide.](https://github.com/miguelmota/ethereum-development-with-go-book/blob/master/en/smart-contract-compile/README.md)  
3. Replace references to the smart contract within the clprice module (within the types folder).
